Welcome to Yokai Batch documentation!
=====================================

**Yokai Batch** is batch processing job library written with PHP, with zero dependencies.

With this library, you will be able to:

* üìë keep track of the execution of your jobs
* üöÄ have base classes to handle batch processing jobs
* ‚ôªÔ∏è have decoupled reusable components to compose your jobs
* üè≠ have bridges with popular libraries and frameworks

What is Batch ?
---------------

| The Batch library solves all your massive data processing problems.
| It can also be seen as an ETL.
| It can works both synchronously & asynchronously.
| It will store execution results, so you can access it afterwards.

How it works ?
--------------

Batch will allow you to declare and execute jobs.

| A job is the class that is responsible for **what** your code is doing.
| This is the class you will have to create (or reuse), as it contains the
  business logic required for what you wish to achieve.

The only requirement is implementing `JobInterface <https://github.com/yokai-php/batch/tree/0.x/src/batch/src/Job/JobInterface.php>`__,

   :doc:`What is a job? <domain/job>`

| When you have your job ready, you will want to execute it.
| This is the responsibility of the job launcher.

| There is multiple implementation of a job launcher across bridges.
| Because batch can work both synchronously & asynchronously, the job launcher might just schedule job's execution.
| Thus, when you ask the job launcher to ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù a job, you have to check
  the ``JobExecution`` status that it had returned to know if the job is
  already executed.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`What is a job launcher? <domain/job-launcher>`

| While the job is being executed, everything that might happen will be remembered in the job execution.
| All the components involved in the job's execution, whenever they access the object, will be able to update it.
| From time to time during the execution, the object will be stored, so you can access it afterwards.
